#	Hint for finding the key combos:
#		Run "cat" and type, everything you type will be echoed to the screen until you type Ctrl-C to quit
#		If you see text like "^[[A", the '^[' is the escape char (1 char, not 2 printable chars), you can make that char by either hitting Ctrl-V Esc in the terminal, or just by using "\e" in whatever file you're putting it into.  "\e" is 2 printable chars, but interpreted as a single escaped char ("\e" = escape char just like "\t" usually = tab char and "\n" = newline char and is often the same as "\x1B" or "\033")
#	View all current key bindings
#		bind -P  # human readable
#		bind -p  # script readable
#		Ex: bind -P | grep "end-of-line"
#	Tell bash to use vim keybinding scheme:
#		set -o vi

	# Keybindings - remap the up and down arrows for more efficient scrolling through history.
	#	Old (default) behavior: up & down cycle through commands in history
	#	New behavior: up & down cycle through commands in history, but ONLY the commands that start with the same letters that are in front of the cursor.
	#		Example: to quickly recall your last grep command(s), type "grep" and then up or down.
bind '"\e[A"':history-search-backward  # Up key (default ?= previous-history) "\M-[A"
bind '"\e[B"':history-search-forward  # Down key (default ?= next-history)
#	For certain systems I haven't fully identified yet
#		The CSEL was sort of like this
#		The terminal on my Mac might use this AFTER I PRINT A CERTAIN FILE TO THE TERMINAL (the 1st 10 lines of the output of vimdiff)
#			Doesn't matter what machine I'm logged into, just that I'm using the Mac's terminal
bind '"\eOA"':history-search-backward  # Up key (default ?= previous-history)
bind '"\eOB"':history-search-forward  # Down key (default ?= next-history)

# Fix Home and End keys on shyamc-linux (already done on thunderstorm)
	# Note: On most machines "Ctrl-A" acts as "Home" and "Ctrl-E" acts as "End"
bind '"\e[1~"':beginning-of-line  # Home key
bind '"\e[4~"':end-of-line  # End key (default ?= end-of-line)

# Fix Mac - these don't seem to be the defaults on Mac like they do on other systems
bind '"\e[5C"':forward-word  # Crtl-Right key
bind '"\e[5D"':backward-word  # Crtl-Left key
#	For Mac when logged in from Ubuntu / Gnome terminal
bind '"\e[1;5C"':forward-word  # Crtl-Right key
bind '"\e[1;5D"':backward-word  # Crtl-Left key
#	For Ubuntu when logged in from Windows 8 / PuTTY
bind '"\eOC"':forward-word  # Crtl-Right key
bind '"\eOD"':backward-word  # Crtl-Left key
