# common-RC-settings
A general repo of all my bash, git, and other miscellaneous settings I've collected over the years.
This is intended to be a general file layout with lots of examples and notes, not an actual set of settings that can be used directly - there's just too many environment specific customizations in many .bashrc setups to keep things like that in sync.
